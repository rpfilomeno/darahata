# DaraHaTa
Lazy Windows event log fast forensics timeline generator and threat hunting script.

The ptoject name is a wordplay on "Dara" means Lazy, "Ha" for Hayabusa and "Ta" for Takajo.

I created this project to lazily scan my Windows laptop for threats. Please refer to https://github.com/Yamato-Security for anything regarding Hayabusa and Takajo or using these tool on any production setting.
